# What is "abstraction"?

- Abstraction is EVERYTHING in language.
- "To represent something in a different way."
- *Indirection* is the first step in abstraction.
- Avoid indirection, unless you can achieve full abstraction.
- Because indirection without abstraction introduces COGNITIVE LOAD.
- An unknown amount of complexity can be represented by a single abstraction.
- Every programmer is a linguist!
- If your job is to create abstractions, then your job is to manage complexity (including budgeting cognitive load) as you solve your overall "business" problems.
